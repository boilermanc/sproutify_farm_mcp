## ⚠️ Schema Mismatches (Need Production Schema)

The failing tests are all due to database column name mismatches. These need to be updated once we have the actual production schema:

### Reports Needing Schema Fixes
1. **Seed Inventory Report** - `crops.name` doesn't exist
2. **Tower Status Report** - `plant_batches.crop_id` relationship issue
3. **Water Test Report** - `water_tests.test_date` doesn't exist
4. **Chemical Inventory Report** - `ipm_chemical_inventory` table doesn't exist

### Slash Commands Needing Schema Fixes
1. **/seed** - `plant_batches.tray_number` doesn't exist
2. **/record ph/ec/temp** - `nutrient_readings.ph_level`, `ec_level`, `reading_date` don't exist
3. **/spray** - `core_spray_applications.application_rate` doesn't exist

10. Spray Applications Report

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Generate Reports
Simply ask Sage:
- "generate seed inventory report"
- "create tower status report"
- "make harvest report"

Reports are saved to `reports/` folder as HTML files.

### Use Slash Commands
Type commands directly:
- `/seed 100 romaine in tray 1`
- `/record ph 6.2 for tower 1.05`
- `/spray regalia on tower 1.05 2 oz`

### Ask Questions
Continue using natural language:
- "what's in my towers?"
- "how do I mix my nutrients?" (training manual)
- "what reports can I run?"

## 📝 Next Steps

### Before Deploying to Production
1. **Get actual database schema** for test farm `624a653c-d36b-47d6-806d-584bd6c2cfcf`
2. **Update column names** in:
   - `src/reports/generator.ts`
   - `src/services/slashCommands.ts`
3. **Re-run tests** to confirm 100% pass rate
4. **Deploy to IONOS** using existing `deploy.sh`

### Schema Discovery Commands
Run these on production database to get actual schema:
```sql
-- List all tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='public';

-- Get columns for specific tables
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name IN ('plant_batches', 'nutrient_readings', 'water_tests', 'core_spray_applications');

-- Check relationships
SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_constraint WHERE contype = 'f';
```
